pages={17-40},
abstract={The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) provides multiple simultaneous high-resolution full-disk images of the corona and transition region up to 0.5 R⊙ above the solar limb with 1.5-arcsec spatial resolution and 12-second temporal resolution. The AIA consists of four telescopes that employ normal-incidence, multilayer-coated optics to provide narrow-band imaging of seven extreme ultraviolet (EUV) band passes centered on specific lines: Fe xviii (94 {\AA}), Fe viii, xxi (131 {\AA}), Fe ix (171 {\AA}), Fe xii, xxiv (193 {\AA}), Fe xiv (211 {\AA}), He ii (304 {\AA}), and Fe xvi (335 {\AA}). One telescope observes C iv (near 1600 {\AA}) and the nearby continuum (1700 {\AA}) and has a filter that observes in the visible to enable coalignment with images from other telescopes. The temperature diagnostics of the EUV emissions cover the range from 6{\texttimes}104 K to 2{\texttimes}107 K. The AIA was launched as a part of NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission on 11 February 2010. AIA will advance our understanding of the mechanisms of solar variability and of how the Sun's energy is stored and released into the heliosphere and geospace.},

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Recent observations demonstrated that sunspot structure can change rapidly and irreversibly after flares. One of the most puzzling results is the increase in magnetic shear around the flaring magnetic polarity inversion line after flares. However, all these observations were made at the photosphere level. In this Letter, we study the altitude variation of the nonpotentiality of the magnetic fields associated with the 4B/X3.4 flare of 2006 December 13. The vector magnetograms with unprecedented quality from Hinode before and after the flare are used as the boundary conditions to extrapolate the three-dimensional nonlinear force-free magnetic fields and the potential fields. The former are computed with the optimization algorithm and the latter with the Green’s function method. At the photosphere boundary, magnetic shear increases after the flare in a local area close to the flaring magnetic polarity inversion line. Two measures of the magnetic nonpotentiality, the weighted mean shear θw and the total magnetic shear θwB, are calculated in this area at progressively higher altitude. By comparing their altitude variation profiles before and after the flare, we find that the nonpotentiality of the local area increases after the flare below ~8 Mm and decreases from that height to ~70 Mm. Beyond 70 Mm, the magnetic fields approach potential for both times.}

abstract={Variations in solar activity, at least as observed in numbers of sunspots, have been apparent since ancient times but to what extent solar variability may affect global climate has been far more controversial. The subject had been in and out of fashion for at least two centuries but the current need to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic causes of climate change has brought it again to the forefront of meteorological research. The absolute radiometers carried by satellites since the late 1970s have produced indisputable evidence that total solar irradiance varies systematically over the 11-year sunspot cycle, relegating to history the term ``solar constant'', but it is difficult to explain how the apparent response to the Sun, seen in many climate records, can be brought about by these rather small changes in radiation. This article reviews some of the evidence for a solar influence on the lower atmosphere and discusses some of the mechanisms whereby the Sun may produce more significant impacts than might be surmised from a consideration only of variations in total solar irradiance.},

abstract={Aditya-L1 is India's first observatory-class solar space mission to study the Sun from the Lagrange L1 point. The Solar Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is one of the payloads onboard Aditya-L1. SUIT is an off-axis Ritchey--Chr{\'e}tien (RC) telescope, which images the Sun onto a 4k{\texttimes}4k CCD covering a field-of-view of 1.5 R⊙ with a plate scale of {\$}0.7''{\$}pixel−1. One of the primary objectives of SUIT is to study the early evolution of solar flares with high temporal cadence in the near-UV wavelengths (200{\thinspace}--{\thinspace}400 nm). The SUIT onboard intelligence was developed to achieve this objective. The complete intelligence algorithm is divided into several sub-modules, each working on a specific aspect of intelligence. These are: the HEL1OS flare-trigger module: generates flare trigger using HEL1OS hard X-ray data, the flare-localization module: locates the flare on the SUIT full-disc images, the Region of Interest (RoI) tracking module: accounts for the shift in RoI coordinates caused by rotation of the Sun, auto-exposure control module: adjusts the exposure time depending upon the flare intensity for better contrast. In this article, these onboard-intelligence modules are explained in detail. The working principles of these modules are tested using available data from various existing missions and also using synthetic data, and the obtained results are presented. The modules are implemented in hardware using an Actel RTAX 2000S FPGA and are tested using a laboratory setup. From the testing, it is found that flares are successfully localized in a mean time of 40 seconds from the GOES soft X-ray catalog start time. Also, a temporal cadence of under three seconds for a single-filter flare RoI image is achieved.},

abstract = {We present RHESSI imaging of three flares (2003 October 28 and 29 and November 2) in the 2.223 MeV neutron-capture gamma-ray line with angular resolution as high as 35''. Comparisons of imaged and spatially integrated fluences show that in all cases most, if not all, of the emission was confined to compact sources with size scales of tens of arcseconds or smaller that are located within the flare active region. Thus, the gamma-ray-producing ions appear to be accelerated by the flare process and not by a widespread shock driven by a fast coronal mass ejection. The 28 October event yielded the first such image to show double-footpoint gamma-ray line sources. These footpoint sources straddled the flaring loop arcade but were displaced from the corresponding 0.2-0.3 MeV electron-bremsstrahlung emission footpoints by 14'' and 17'' ± 5''. As with the previously studied 2002 July 23 event, this implies spatial differences in acceleration and/or propagation between the flare-accelerated ions and electrons.}

abstract = {Imaging of gamma-ray lines, produced by nuclear collisions of energetic ions with the solar atmosphere, provides the only direct indication of the spatial properties of accelerated ions near the Sun. We present the first gamma-ray images of a solar flare, obtained with the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) for the X4.8 flare of 2002 July 23. Two rotating modulation collimators (with 35'' and 183'' resolution) were used to obtain images for the same time interval in four energy bands: the narrow deuterium line at 2.223 MeV formed by the thermalization and capture of neutrons produced in the collisions; the 3.25-6.5 MeV band that includes the prompt de-excitation lines of C and O; and the 0.3-0.5 and 0.7-1.4 MeV bands that are dominated by electron bremsstrahlung. The centroid of the 2.223 MeV image was found to be displaced by 20′′ ± 6′′ from that of the 0.3-0.5 MeV image, implying a difference in acceleration and/or propagation between the accelerated electron and ion populations near the Sun.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {RHESSI observations of the 2002 July 23 solar flare have shown that hard X-rays and gamma rays are produced in different locations within the flare volume. The gamma-ray emission, which is a diagnostic of ion acceleration, appears to originate in the vicinity of large loops, while the hard X-ray emission, a diagnostic of electron acceleration, originates near shorter loops. The tendency for a stochastic acceleration model based on cascading MHD turbulence to favor ion acceleration in larger acceleration regions has been previously noted. Here we evaluate this effect quantitatively and show that such a model is consistent with the RHESSI observations.}

The search was performed on a 10.8 kton-year exposure of KamLAND collected from 2002 to 2019. This large exposure allows us to explore previously unconstrained parameter space for solar flare neutrinos. We found no statistical excess of neutrinos and established 90% confidence level upper limits of 8.4 × 107 cm−2 (3.0 × 109 cm−2) on the electron antineutrino (electron neutrino) fluence at 20 MeV normalized to the X12 flare, assuming that the neutrino fluence is proportional to the X-ray intensity.}

SUIT continuously provides near-simultaneous full-disk and region-of-interest images of the Sun, slicing through the photosphere and chromosphere and covering a field of view up to 1.5 solar radii. For this purpose, SUIT uses 11 filters tuned at different wavelengths in the 200 – 400 nm range, including the Mg ii h and k and Ca ii H spectral lines. The observations made by SUIT help us understand the magnetic coupling of the lower and middle solar atmosphere. In addition, for the first time, this allows for the measurements of spatially resolved solar broad-band radiation in the near- and mid-ultraviolet, which will help constrain the variability of the solar ultraviolet irradiance in a wavelength range that is central for the chemistry of ozone and oxygen the Earth’s stratosphere. This paper discusses the details of the instrument and data products.},

The attenuation of ultraviolet radiation by air near the ground was measured as a function of wavelength under a wide variety of meteorological conditions. These measurements were made over the tops of buildings at the California Institute of Technology on 125 nights between March 1949 and March 1950. Attenuation coefficients in km[...] have been plotted against wavelengths in Angstroms for 78 representative nights.

The primary data were obtained from four independent experiments, two which yielded coefficients as a continuous function of wavelength from 2300A to 4600A, and two which monitored coefficients at 2537A and at 5500A. The first method employed photographic spectrophotometry to compare the light transmitted through two paths differing in length by 680 meters. The second method was similar but utilized other apparatus and a path difference of 340 meters. The third method involved mercury lamps and cadmium photocells, and the fourth method consisted of visual observations with a Loofah hazemeter.

Except for the Herzberg 02 bands in the neighborhood of 2500A, the attenuation coefficient was found to vary smoothly (though differently) with wavelength on all nights analyzed, including many when smog was present in noticeable concentrations. Attenuation data for unpolluted air were successfully fitted by a simple empirical formula involving wavelength and visibility range as parameters.},

In this paper, we describe flare-associated emissions via a statistical study of 477 M- and X-class flares as observed by the Extreme UltraViolet Sensor on board the 15th Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, which has been monitoring the full-disk solar Lyα irradiance on 10-s timescales over the course of Solar Cycle 24. The vast majority (95\%) of these flares produced Lyα enhancements of 10\% or less above background levels, with a maximum increase of ∼30\%. The irradiance in Lyα was found to exceed that of the 1–8 Å X-ray irradiance by as much as two orders of magnitude in some cases, although flares that occurred closer to the solar limb were found to exhibit less of a Lyα enhancement. This center-to-limb variation was verified through a joint, stereoscopic observation of an X-class flare that appeared near the limb as viewed from Earth, but close to disk center as viewed by the MAVEN spacecraft in orbit around Mars. The frequency distribution of peak Lyα was found to have a power-law slope of 2.8±0.27. We also show that increased Lyα flux is closely correlated with induced currents in the ionospheric E-layer through the detection of the solar flare effect as observed by the Kakioka magnetometer.},
